# arithmetics

This task is created to help understand polymorphysm.

== Preparation ==
1) [Download](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and [Install](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) maven;
2) [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install Git;
3) Checkout this repository to a local machine using command: `git clone https://github.com/codeshnippet/arithmetics.git`;
4) Go to project folder 'arithmetics';
5) Run `mvn install`
This operation will run the tests and you will see that 4 tests are failing.

== Task ==
1) Fix failing tests by providing correct implementation to `ArithmeticService.calculate(BinaryOperation operation)` and `ArithmeticService.calculate(BinaryOperation... operations)`
2) Make sure you are using polymorphism

== Optional ==
1) Build a command line application that would prompt for multiple binary operations and output list of results.
